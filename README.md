# friend-face
This SwiftUI project is a result of the fourth 'milestone' in "Hacking With Swift's 100 Days of SwiftUI". This basic social media app displays a list of users and indicates if they are online or not. Selecting a user opens a new view with more information on the user and their friend list, which is also selectable. This app utilizes URL session to download fake json user data and Core Data to persist the data locally. 

This project follows the brief <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/60" target="_blank">here</a>
, from Paul Hudson's "100 Days of Swift UI" tutorial program.

Please see the below video of the app run on an iPhone 14 Pro simulator.
